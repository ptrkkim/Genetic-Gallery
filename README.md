A custom config boilerplate for React apps, made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Configurations beyond base Create-React-App:
- Flow typing with ESLint integration
- Linting recommendations for Javascript (airbnb), Jest and Flow
- Enzyme and react-test-renderer for component unit testing

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run flow`

Runs flow to type check any files annotated with @flow.<br>
ESLint will give flow-related hints without having to run this command.
